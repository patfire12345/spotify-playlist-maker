# Spotify Playlist Maker 

With the assistance of the Spotify API, the Spotify Playlist Maker is designed to personalize an individual's Spotify experience through an interactive music selection process. Whether someone is a new user or an avid listener, the Spotify Playlist Maker aims to satisfy one's musical needs in the form of a playlist created through a selective process with the listener's participation similar to the dating app, Tinder.
